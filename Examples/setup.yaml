# Configure the specific molecules we will use for our systems
# Note: We do not specify what the "receptor" and what the "ligand" is yet
molecules:
  # Define our receptor, T4-Lysozyme, we can call it whatever we want so we just use its name here as the directive

    filepath: input/receptor.mol2
  # Define our ligand molecule
  a1:
    filepath: input/ligand.mol2
    # Get the partial charges for the ligand by generating them from antechamber with the AM1-BCC charge method
    antechamber:
      charge_method: bcc

# Define the solvent for our system, here we use Particle Mesh Ewald for long range interactions
solvents:
  # We can title this solvent whatever we want. We just call it "pme" for easy remembering

    nonbonded_method: PME #This option is needed for YANK but not used by Fluorify
    nonbonded_cutoff: 9*angstroms # Cutoff between short- and long-range interactions
    # Define how far away the periodic boundaries are from the receptor.
    # The volume will be filled with TIP3P water through LEaP

    negative_ion: Cl-

# Define the systems: What is the ligand, receptor, and solvent we put them in
systems:
  # We can call our system anything we want, this example just uses a short name for the receptor hyphenated with the ligand
  TEST:
    # These names all use the names we defined previously
